# CureQuest
AI revolutionizes health: Predict. Prevent. Prevail
## Inspiration

The inspiration behind CureQuest came from the realization that existing healthcare machine learning models have limitations in efficiently predicting multiple diseases and optimizing algorithms for different hardware architectures. The team recognized the need for a comprehensive system that could accurately predict various diseases while leveraging advanced hardware optimization tools.

## What it does

CureQuest is a groundbreaking AI-powered medical platform that enables patients to detect six critical diseases from the comfort of their homes, using just a few clicks. Leveraging the power of Intel® oneAPI Tools, the platform integrates advanced machine learning algorithms and deep neural networks to provide accurate test results for Brain Tumor Detection, Breast Cancer Detection, Alzheimer's Detection, Diabetes Detection, Pneumonia Detection, and Heart Disease Detection.

## How we built it

To build CureQuest, we utilized Intel® oneAPI Tools, specifically the Intel® AI Analytics Toolkit (AI Kit), which played a crucial role in optimizing our machine learning models for Intel architecture. By integrating oneAPI into scikit-learn and enhancing deep learning APIs like Keras, our team achieved improved performance and efficiency. We employed pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and developed custom-made CNNs for disease detection, ensuring accurate predictions.

## Challenges we ran into

Throughout the development of CureQuest, we encountered several challenges, including handling large datasets, optimizing algorithms for different diseases, and achieving high accuracy with limited training data. Additionally, integrating Intel® oneAPI Tools into our project required careful planning and expertise, but the efforts were well worth it, given the exceptional performance enhancements they provided.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are immensely proud of creating CureQuest, a cutting-edge medical solution that addresses the inefficiencies of traditional healthcare models. Through the seamless integration of Intel® oneAPI Tools, our platform demonstrates remarkable accuracy in disease detection, achieving results ranging from 66.8% to an impressive 100%. Moreover, offering six critical disease detections under one comprehensive platform sets CureQuest apart, providing immense value and convenience to patients.

## What we learned

During the development of CureQuest, we learned the importance of leveraging advanced AI tools like Intel® oneAPI to optimize machine learning models effectively. The integration of oneAPI into our platform significantly improved the performance and efficiency of our algorithms on Intel architecture. Additionally, we gained insights into disease detection techniques using various algorithms like VGG-16, Random Forest, custom-made CNNs, and XGBoost, which contributed to our overall success.

## What's next for CureQuest

Looking ahead, CureQuest has an exciting future ahead. The platform will continuously evolve with the availability of more data, which will enhance the accuracy of disease predictions even further. We plan to expand the platform's capabilities by adding more disease detections, including those detectable through X-ray scans or simple input. Additionally, we aim to provide patients with information about necessary precautions and how to manage their health if they test positive for a particular disease. By storing detection records, CureQuest will enable doctors to monitor patients' health and track their progress, making it a truly comprehensive and life-changing medical solution.

In conclusion, CureQuest represents the epitome of innovation in the healthcare industry. With its powerful AI-driven disease detection capabilities, it can analyze patient data rapidly and accurately, leading to improved patient outcomes and cost-effective healthcare solutions. The seamless integration of Intel® oneAPI Tools further solidifies its position as a groundbreaking platform that can revolutionize the way diseases are detected and managed.
